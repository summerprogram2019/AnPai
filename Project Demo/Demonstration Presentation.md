# Demonstration Presentation

## Introduction and Overview

###Brief

An Pai Technology is a company passionate about discovering new food and travel. An Pai is set on providing a service for tourists to allow them to travel to China and try new high-quality food using their mobile phones. An Pai provides a simple user interface that allows the user to select the best restaurants in their local area. An Pai is an app that will relive the stress of having to find food in a foreign country, with its translated menus and a large database of reviews, the user will never have to worry about what to eat again.

### Goals

An Pai is an application that makes it easier for people to chose suitable restaurants that suits their tastes and interests. With its helpful reviews and recommendations the user can achieve an optimal dining experience in a foreign country. An Pai is dedicated to the communication and aggregation of the urban dining and takeaway experience. In the App there will be a large database of Restaurants that have crowd sourced reviews, ratings, and menu translations. These pages are created by the public for the public. Every user is free to review the business whether good or bad. The app gives you the ability to share your meal experience with everyone. An Pai, through the internet and GPS tracking, will allow the user to decide on a restaurant that is the most convenient. The app provides interaction between the businesses and the users. This will open a door way to coupons and discounts not only in the food industry but any industry that is willing to advertise on the application. 

## The Process

The process first started by discussing what industry was to be chosen. It was discussed that we would chose the food industry. Even though the food industry in China is massive and extremely competitive, China lacks any support for tourists looking for food. Our application was built on the belief that tourists coming to China should not have to worry about where they are going to eat or have to stress about translating menus. An Pai has many reviews and many restaurants with translated menus all you have to do is open the app, it knows your location and all you need to do is select a restaurant you desire

## The Management

- **Gabe**: Team Manager
- **Frank**: System Architect
- **Hannah**: Quality Control and Testing
- **Belinda**: Business Manager
- **Aaron**: Programmer
- **Ahmed**: Marketing Manager

Every morning we would have a meeting and discuss the goals and tasks for the day, discuss who would be working on those tasks and organise a to do list that was achievable. A typical morning would start with everyone getting settled in, and then once everyone was present i would start our meeting which i had prepared either the night before or the morning of. Once everyone had their tasks we would commence working.

## Solving Issues

###Technical (Software) Issues

As Aaron was the lead software engineer and the main programmer he was the only one that would have software issues. All of the 

###Non-Technical Issues

Most of the tasks in the team required two people to be working on it at a given time so there were very few issues. If there was an issue the person would ask whoever was in charge of that field or just ask the group. There was

## Iteration 1 Goals

 **WHAT** 
We want to develop an app that can review and order food. This app will include features such as menu translations, delivery through third-party applications and the ability to earn points (pie points) by giving valid reviews and menu translations. 

**WHO** 
The application will focus on international tourists coming to China. These tourists are unable to speak Chinese and require the application to help them find nearby restaurants will simple translations and comprehensive reviews. 

**WHY** 
We want to help provide a better food experience for tourists in China. We aim to make ordering food simple with an easy to use app. Our app allows the user to choose a restaurant based on its distance and its reviews to ensure the quality of a product. 

**WHERE** 
Our main focus will be in Australia and China with menu translations in the following five languages: English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian 

**WHEN** 
The apps main purpose is to be used when the user is in search of high-quality food near their current location. The app will be most popular during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

**HOW** 
By having a database of restaurants and their locations and details. These locations will need reviews and translations. We will need to research the local food industries and applications that offer similar features.  

## Iteration 2 Goals 

###Changes from Iteration 1

 **WHAT** 
Scrapped the food delivery as it was not in the scope of what our company was aiming to achieve.

**WHO** 
focus changed from international tourists to just English speaking tourists. As of now translating from Chinese to English was quite difficult so it did not seem feasible to add more languages to translate more than English.

**WHY** 
We removed the ordering to make way for a forum which we thought would be better for our application.

**WHERE** 
At the moment the two main locations will be Australia and China

**WHEN** 
The apps main purpose is to be used when the user is in search of high-quality food near their current location. The app will be most popular during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

**HOW** 
By having a database of restaurants and their locations and details. These locations will need reviews and translations. We will need to research the local food industries and applications that offer similar features.  

## Iteration 3 Goals

### Changes from Iteration 2

 **WHAT** 
Scrapped the pie points because we can no way of monitoring the users points and making sure there was no foul play

**WHY** 
removed the forum section because there was no need for a forum section at this point in time as we still hadnt fullly implemented reviewing and commenting

**WHERE** 
Main focus will just be in China

## The UI vs Actual

*Show photos of the UI

Here are the designs of the UI that was agreed upon by the team

*Show photos of the Actual App

Here are screen shots of the Application. As you can see the outcome was slightly different due to limitations with Android Studio

## Plan for the future

## Reflections

###WEEK 1

In our first week we focused on establishing roles, finding the industry we wanted to focus on and brainstorming ideas for innovation in our field. We looked at each team member’s skills and experience, to find roles that would best suit everyone. We quickly established that we all shared a passion for food, so we decided our app would focus on the food industry. To bring innovation in this area though, we knew would be a challenge since there already exists so many apps and websites dedicated to finding, ordering and reviewing meals. So, to bring something unique to our app we decided to focus on helping Australian tourists travelling to China to find restaurants easily. We wanted to provide translated menus, links to food ordering services, a restaurant reservation service and heaps of other features too.

###WEEK 2

Last week we began building our app. Aaron started in Android studio, Gabe designed the database in mySQL, Frank looked at connecting the app and the database, Ahmed and Hannah looked at the logo and UI design and Belinda started on the documentation. Aaron got the GPS features working. But we quickly realised there was going to be issues connecting the database and the app. We also soon realised that a lot of our ideas for our app were not going to be achievable in the timeframe given. Reflecting on last week we could also say that we weren’t as productive as we could have been. We found working in the main room difficult due to the noise, and we also making good use of our morning meetings.

###WEEK 3

This week we worked hard to cut down on our ideas and focus on what we could achieve. We concentrated on the functionality and our presentation rather than the wiki, since this was more pressing. As a group we’ve also tried to improve our productivity and communication. We’ve been having meetings every morning, where we catch up on everyone’s progress and then delegate new tasks. Last week we had issues where at times people would run out work to do, but we’ve found this week that the meetings have improved productivity and if someone runs out of work they can just check the meeting notes on GitHub to find new tasks. We’ve also been communicating more through WeChat to organise things outside of class so we can be productive in the time we have together each morning.
